			<h3>Preparation for mid-term evaluation</h3>
			
			<p>Because this week is for mid-term evaluation, so I will give a short summary of what I have done in previous several weeks.</p>
			
			<p>Basically, I have been focusing on B-rep primitives and submitted two patches about my work. The first one is to integrate plate mode into brep, fortunately, there exists a built-in variable(in openNURBS) that can be used to store user defined data, so we can use it directly to give thickness value to brep. After this, we need to do ray tracing for it. I have made lots of reasonable tests and compare the results with BoT primitives, because the routines implemented in BoT are good examples to follow. More details can be found in my previous post on this blog.</p>
			
			<h3>What to do next?</h3>
			
			<p>TBD (tessellation of B-rep?)</p>
